• Created an online meal recommendation and food delivery web application that suggests meals to users on the basis of their nutritional requirements and fitness goals.<br>
• Made use of AWS services like S3, API Gateway, Cognito, Sagemaker, DynamoDB, Lambda and OpenSearch.<br>
• Utilized an online food dataset which included meals with their nutrition value to train a machine learning model which gave us customized meal plans for the user to choose.
